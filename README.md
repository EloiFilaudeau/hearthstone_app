This project consists of a mobile application to manage **Hearthstone** cards, in particular to save your card collection and build a deck <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(game)>. This application is developed thanks to Android Studio and uses the api <http://hearthstoneapi.com/> (documented here: <https://market.mashape.com/omgvamp/hearthstone>).
Hearthstone cards are either Servant cards, Sort cards or Weapon cards (<https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone#Cartes>).
